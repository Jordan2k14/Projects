# Rock Paper Scissors - Python

## About

I created a Rock Paper Scissors programme. This is a random simulation similar
to a real game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. 

## How to Use

- When you run the programme you will be prompt with a message
- The message will say "Rock, Paper or Scissors?!"
- The user must type either "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"
- Using Randint the CPU will be generated a random choice between "Rock", "Paper"
or "Scissors"
- You will then get a message saying you won or lost
- This is all a  randomised simulation. Similar to a real life game of Rock, Paper, Scissors
