# Alarm Clock



## About the Project

The main goal of the project was to implement an alarm clock using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. The reason why I felt Python was the best language to use for this project was because it has very practical libraries such as the date time library and tkinter library. These libraries help us get the current date and time and as well provide a user interface to set the alarm clock according to the requirement in a 24 hour format. 


## Usage
```
python3 alarm_clock.py 
```

## Why we used Python & Tkinter
Both Python and Tkinter, were used to create a fast and simple GUI application. Tkinter is great in a way it provides a powerful object-orientated interface. This makes the project very simple and user friendly. I used the subprocess library to create an alarm noise when the alarm hits the set time. This acts as a reminder for the alarm clock
